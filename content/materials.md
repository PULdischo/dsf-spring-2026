---

We've collected and listed the materials you will need to succeed in this series. We will walk you through installing and using  any software listed here.

## Software and Tools

`A Text Editor:` The instructor will use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in all demonstrations so if you do not have a preferred text editor, we recommend downloading the software. Please confirm that your computer meets [the system requirements](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements). Feel free to wait to download the software until one of our sessions.

The following [VS Code extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/extensions/extension-marketplace) will expand the capabilities of VS code and make it easier for you to work with our course materials:

- [Rainbow CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv)
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
- [Edit CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=janisdd.vscode-edit-csv)
- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)

`GitHub:` [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a version control platform that enables collaboration and facilitates the simplification of static site generation through their [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) service.

`GitHub Desktop:` The [GitHub Desktop client](https://github.com/apps/desktop) simplifies version control and makes it easier to move between a remote and local repository.

`Google Sheets:` We will avoid Excel and build metadata spreadsheets in Google Sheets.

`MapWarper:` [MapWarper](https://mapwarper.net/) is a free to use, open-source map warper / map georectifier, and image georeferencer tool for individuals and small groups.

`OpenRefine:` [OpenRefine] (https://openrefine.org/download) is a powerful free, open source tool for working with messy data.

## Research Materials

You will be provided with research materials so that we can collaborate and engage with varying tools. You are welcome to bring your own materials as well, or at the very least questions about your own project.
